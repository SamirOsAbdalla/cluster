# Sections

<strong>Cluster</strong> is designed to be simple which lends itself to having clean 
and easy-to-manage sections depending on what action the user wants to perform.

- The initial <a href="#home">home</a> page
- The <a href="#tasks">tasks</a> page
- The <a href="#inbox">inbox</a> page
- The current <a href="#groups">group's</a> page

## Home Page

The home page for each member is comprised of two parts:
- The groups that the current user is a part of
- The urgent tasks that the user currently has

"Urgent" is a modifier assigned to a task at task creation (and can be assigned after if the task creator wishes it). Urgent tasks are displayed on the home page to gives users insight as to what their most pressing tasks are.

From the home page, the user can create a new group and invite members using the invited member's email.

## Groups

Each member can create their own group and invite others to join. Group creators
can edit information about the group, such as its name, at any point. Clicking on a group
takes the user to the group page where information about group members, group tasks, etc. are 
displayed.


## Tasks

Any group member can create a task however once a task is created only the task creator
can edit the task. Following task creation, a task creator can assign group members to a task.Clicking on a task on the home page takes a user to the group page that contains that task, while clicking on a task in the group page reveals more information about that task.

Task information includes comments, task creation details, and assigned member status' for that
task. Each task member has a status of either "In Progress" or "Completed" for a task.



## Inbox

Each user has an inbox that contains invites from other users to join a group.
