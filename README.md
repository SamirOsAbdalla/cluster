# Sections

<strong>Cluster</strong> is designed to be simple which lends itself to having clean 
and easy-to-manage sections depending on what action the user wants to perform.

- The initial <a href="#home page">home</a> page
- The <a href="#tasks">tasks</a> page
- The <a href="#inbox">inbox</a> page
- The current <a href="#groups">group's</a> page

## Home Page

The home page for each member is comprised of two parts:
- The groups that the current user is a part of
- The urgent tasks that the user currently has

"Urgent" is a modifier assigned to a task at task creation (and can be assigned after if the task creator wishes it). Urgent tasks are displayed on the home page to gives users insight as to what their most pressing tasks are.

From the home page, the user can create a new group and invite members using the invited member's email.

## Tasks

The tasks page simply shows all of the current user's tasks no matter which group they are a part of.
Its purpose is to provide an overall view of the work assigned to a given user without having to look
through each of their groups.


## Inbox

Each user has an inbox that contains invites from other users to join a group. From here, the user
can elect to either join the group or reject the invitation. If the user decides to join the group,
they will of course have access to all of the group's tasks, member list, etc.

## Groups

This page has by far the most information to display but it is very easy to follow. The parts of the page
are broken down below
- The group member list
- All of the tasks pertaining to that group
- The task information when a specific task is clicked

### 1. Member list

The purpose of this component is as it sounds. However, if you are the creator of the group this is 
where you would actually be able to kick people out of the group if you so desire (so much power).

### 2. Group tasks
All of the group tasks are displayed in this section. Once the user is done with a task, they can "complete"
the task which will then show up on the task information page

### 3. Task Information
The purpose of this component is to give a succinct summary of the clicked task. From its creation date, comments, assigned members, etc., user's can get a quick feel of the essentials.
